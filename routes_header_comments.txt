 * The following 3 questions are answered by the graphing analysis:
 * 1- What roads stand out as the best path to take to escape?
 *  > This question can be answered by looking at the shortest
 *    path along the directed graph.  If the graph were to be
 *    undirected, this question could be answered simply by taking
 *    the convex hull of all intersection vertex-points, but since
 *    it is directed, a shortest path finding algorithm must be
 *    implemented after first creating a graphical representation
 *    of the streets and intersections.
 * 
 * 2- What are the bottleneck roads of escape? (Which roads get
 * clogged up first in an evacuation of large enough scale to clog
 * some roads?)
 *  > This question is answered by evacuation analysis using a
 *    Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm, specifically through it's max-flow
 *    and min-cut finding properties.  The road-edges that are
 *    not, according to the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm, in the min-cut
 *    have reached their bottleneck capacity for a current
 *    road population distribution.
 * 
 * 3- What matters more: the travel capacity of a road, or how close
 * to normal wrt to the explosion radius road's direction is?
 *  > This question can be answered by observing the effects of using
 *    different roadway capacities and different explosion radii in
 *    the simulation portion of the project 'Routes' is a sub-class of.
 *    The importance of capacity and explosion radius are only comparable
 *    within the explosion radius, and they are comparable in importance
 *    there because a smaller radius covers a smaller and more diluted
 *    representation of the total population while road capacity, though
 *    considering the total population along each road-edge, can allow
 *    looser or stricter fluctuation in the magnitutde of evactuation
 *    along each individual road-segment, affecting the whole network.
